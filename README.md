### Project: Telecom Churn

In this we have data about calls of different states with area code like total minutes call, total charger and people are calling in day or night. This competition is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning".  The dataset contains 333 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 Boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample.

We applied Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier and SVC Classifier algorithms
